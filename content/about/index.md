Hello! I'm Bhavi, a Software Engineer based in Bangalore, India.

Recently promoted to the designation of SDE-II at [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com).

Completed a 2-year Masters program in CSE at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) in May 2020.
Prior to enrolling for the Masters program, I held a position of Lead Engineer and had six years of work experience in delivering top results in systems and software development.
With an intention to enhance my skill set and get exposure to today's cutting-edge technologies, I decided to go for higher studies. I adapted to the fast paced learning environment of IIIT-H quickly and came out with flying colours.

I'm good at leading technical discussions with software developers and other stakeholders, and,
aim at building products that are performant and scalable.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
